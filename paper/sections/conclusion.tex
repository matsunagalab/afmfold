\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we proposed a novel model, \Model, to predict the 3D conformation of biomolecules directly from AFM images. 
\Model enables accurate and fast conformation estimation compared to previous approaches. 
With further improvements, it has the potential to advance the understanding of biochemical reactions and serve as a powerful tool for exploring biological phenomena in both structural and dynamic aspects.
