\subsection{Molecular dynamics simulation}
\label{subsec:md}

To verify the \Model framework, we performed MD simulations of \AK and \flhac. 
For \AK, we performed an all-atom MD simulation to compare the distribution of conformational states sampled by MD with those generated by an \AFiii clone (Protenix \cite{bytedance2025protenix}) for training the g-CNN. Simulations were conducted using the Amber ff14SB force field \cite{maier_ff14sb_2015} with the TIP3P-FB water model and ions \cite{wang_building_2014}, starting from the open crystal structure (PDB ID: 4AKE). The simulations were carried out at 300~K and 1~atm using OpenMM \cite{eastman_openmm_2024}, and the trajectory was extended to 450~ns to ensure sufficient sampling of the conformational space.

For \flhac, due to computational time constraints, we did not conduct all-atom MD simulations. Instead, we generated conformational ensembles using a set of MD surrogate models: AlphaFlow \cite{jing2024alphaflow} and BioEmu \cite{bioemu2025}, as well as \AFii with MSA subsampling \cite{delAlamo2022sampling} using ColabFold \cite{mirdita2022colabfold}. These generative approaches enabled us to obtain a diverse ensemble of conformations, facilitating a comprehensive comparison with the distribution generated by our \Model framework.
