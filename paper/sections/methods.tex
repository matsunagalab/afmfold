\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

In this section, we present our methodology in two parts. First, we describe how we processed AFM images to extract key structural variables, specifically by relying on the theoretical framework of steerable CNNs \cite{e2cnn}. Second, we explain how we restrained the diffusion process of \AFiii using the structural variables.
