Direct observation of biomolecules in action is fundamental to elucidating the mechanisms of their activity. High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) is a powerful technique that enables direct visualization of protein morphology and dynamics in solution. However, AFM is intrinsically limited to measuring the surface geometry of molecules, which precludes atomic-level structural characterization.
Here, we propose \Model, a generative AI-driven approach to reconstruct atomic-level protein structures from AFM images. \Model navigates the sampling trajectory of \AFiii \cite{Abramson2024, bytedance2025protenix} with AFM-derived structural restraints, progressively guiding it towards conformations consistent with experimental AFM data. 
We evaluated \Model through a twin experiment: using pseudo-AFM images of Adenylate kinase, we first validated our framework and demonstrated that it can reproduce conformations closely resembling the ground truth. Furthermore, we applied \Model to real experimental data of the flagellar protein \flhac and showed that it outperforms rigid-body fitting for reproducing AFM images.
Our method enables rapid structure estimation from AFM images, making it possible to process all frames in AFM movies and opening new avenues for the study of protein conformational dynamics.
