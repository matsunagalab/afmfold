\subsection{Verification using pseudo-AFM images: Adenylate Kinase}
\label{subsec:ak_results}

Adenylate Kinase (\AK) is a well-studied monomeric enzyme known for its large-scale conformational transitions. It is composed of three relatively rigid domains: the central CORE domain (residues 1–29, 68–117, and 161–214), the AMP-binding domain (AMPbd; residues 30–67), and the lid-like ATP-binding domain (LID; residues 118–167). Experimental and computatinoal studies have suggested that upon ligand binding, the enzyme undergoes a transition from an inactive open conformation to an active closed conformation (see \Cref{fig:overview}~(c)). Here, we evaluated how accurately \Model reconstructs 3D conformations of \AK from artificially created pseudo ``experimental'' AFM images. 

\paragraph{Quality of the conformational ensemble generated by \AFiii}
First, we checked the quality of the conformational ensemble generated by \AFiii used for the training of the g-CNN. Here, the conformations were generated by steering \AFiii with CV values on a grid as described in \Cref{subsubsec:afm-prep}. As the CVs, we used the inter-domain distances of all possible combinations of domain pairs (LID--CORE, CORE--AMPbd, and AMPbd--LID). To obtain physically plausible structures as accurately as possible via steering to the target CVs, we systematically evaluated generated structures using various steering schedules with different strengths and onset timings, and selected an optimal schedule strategy (see Supporting Information S1 for details). \Cref{fig:ak_cnn_training}~(b) shows the generated conformations projected to the LID--CORE, and CORE--AMPbd distances (colored by the AMPbd--LID distance), in comparison with \Cref{fig:ak_cnn_training}~(a), which shows the projection of the conformations sampled by a 450~ns MD simulation. Compared with the MD simulation, the conformations generated by \AFiii adequately cover a broad conformational space of \AK,  including both closed (PDB ID: 1AKE) and open (PDB ID: 4AKE) crystal structures. This means that the g-CNN trained on this ensemble can learn the broad relationship between AFM images and the inter-domain distances of \AK.

\paragraph{Accuracy of the g-CNN}
Next, we investigated whether the trained g-CNN accurately estimates CV values from given pseudo-AFM images. Here, we estimated CV values from pseudo-AFM images emulated using randomly chosen conformations from the MD simulation trajectory. The pseudo-AFM images were generated with the settings described in \Cref{tab:afm_settings}. \Cref{fig:ak_cnn_training}~(c) shows the distribution of the root squared error in the CV space between the estimated values with the trained g-CNN and the ground-truth values. With the exceptions of some outlier errors greater than 0.500~nm, the trained g-CNN achieves the average squared error of 0.254~nm, which is enough resolution to capture intermediate conformational states of \AK. 

\paragraph{Accuracy of \AFiii steering}
Then, we investigated the accuracy of the estimated conformations of our \Model framework. As a demonstration, we first estimated the closed and open conformations of \AK from the pseudo-AFM images emulated from the closed and open crystal structures (the images are shown in \Cref{fig:overview}~(b)), respectively. \Cref{fig:overview}~(c) show the estimated structures by the protocol of \Model (i.e., g-CNN and \AFiii steering). The RMSD between the ground-truth and reconstructed conformations was 0.216~nm for the closed form and 0.176~nm for the open form, respectively. Considering that the RMSD between the closed and open crystal structures is 0.715~nm, \Model estimation is accurate enough to identify the two states. The c.c. between the AFM images created from the estimated conformations and the given ``experimental'' pseudo-AFM image is 0.997 for the closed form and 0.998 for the open form, respectively (here, \Cref{eq:cc} was used to compute the c.c.). 

We then evaluated the RSMDs of the conformations estimated from the pseudo-AFM emulated from radomly chosen confrmations from the MD simulation trajectory. \Cref{fig:ak_cnn_training}~(e) shows the distribution of the RMSDs between the ground-truth and estimated conformations. Overall, the RMSD values are low and, aside from a small number of outliers, most RMSDs are distributed around the mean value of approximately 0.281~nm. \Cref{fig:ak_cnn_training}~(d) shows the scatter plot of the RMSD and the root squared errors of the predicted CVs between the ground-truth and estimated conformations. Although a reasonable correlation is observed between the two measures, some scatter was observed in RMSD at similar squared error levels; that is, even with comparable CV errors, the RMSDs can vary. Upon close inspection of the generated structures, we found that this arises because a given set of current CVs (inter-domain distances) does not always uniquely determine the domain arrangement. Specifically, either hinge-bending (open--close transition) or shear-like (twisted) domain motions can yield similar inter-domain distances, despite resulting in structurally distinct conformations. This degeneracy in the CV--structure mapping explains the occurrence of RMSD outliers even when the predicted CV values are accurate.

%A second factor that degrades reconstruction accuracy is the quality of the images themselves.
%\Cref{fig:ak_accuracy}~(a) shows the distribution of RMSD between the ground-truth and predicted conformations.
%While most cases exhibit low RMSD, a subset shows high RMSD in \Cref{fig:ak_accuracy}~(a).
%\Cref{fig:ak_accuracy}~(b) shows the distribution of the c.c. between the reference images and the %pseudo-AFM images generated by rigid-body fitting of the predictions to the reference.
%In contrast to RMSD, \Cref{fig:ak_accuracy}~(b) is skewed toward high c.c.
%Indeed, \Cref{fig:ak_accuracy}~(c) indicates that even when RMSD is relatively high, c.c. can remain high (upper-right region), suggesting that some of the reference AFM image does not sufficiently determine inter-domain distances.
%Taken together, despite the presence of systematic errors stemming from methodological limitations of \Model, the framework reliably distinguishes large-scale domain motions with high probability overall.

\paragraph{Correlation coefficient and robustness against noise}
%So far, we have evaluated the estimation accuracy of \Model using noise-free pseudo-AFM images. To assess whether our approach is applicable to real experimental data, we next investigated the prediction accuracy using pseudo-AFM images with added noise.
%From \cref{fig:noise_robustness}, we observed the following. 
To investigate the applicability of our approach to real experimental data, we next focused on two aspects: (i) the development of evaluation metrics that can be computed without ground-truth structures and (ii) the assessment of robustness in structure estimation accuracy against noise.
As for the first aspect, following the previous study \cite{Niina2020}, we propose to use the c.c. between the given experimental image and a pseudo-AFM image created by rigid-body fitting of the estimated structure to the experimental image maximizing the c.c. values.
\Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(a) shows the density of the c.c. between the ``experimental'' images (pseudo-AFM images created from randomly selected structures from the MD data) and pseudo-AFM images created by rigid-body fitting of the estimated structures. With the exceptions of some outlier values, the distribution is centered around the average value of 0.998, indicating that the estimated structures are in good agreement with the given images. \Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(b) shows the scatter plot of the c.c. and the RMSD. 
A clear negative correlation is observed between the c.c. and the RMSD, suggesting that, even when ground-truth structures are unavailable and RMSD cannot be computed, as is often the case with real experimental data, the comparison of c.c.\ values provides a useful indication of the reliability of the estimated structures.

Next, we focused on the second aspect, the assessment of robustness in structure estimation accuracy against noise. So far, we have used noise-free pseudo-AFM images for both the training and inference stages. To assess the robustness of the estimation against noise, we firstly added noise to ``experimental'' pseudo-AFM data in the inference stage using Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.3 nm (which is a typical noise level for HS-AFM images \cite{Niina2020}). 
\Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(c) shows the scatter plot of the c.c. and the RMSD using the noisy ``experimental'' pseudo-AFM images. Still, a clear negative correlation is observed between the c.c. and the RMSD, suggesting that the c.c. values would work even when noisy real experimental data are used.

Furthermore, for systematic evaluation of the robustness against various noise levels, 
we systematically varied the noise levels added to both the training and the ``experimental'' pseudo-AFM data. \Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(d) illustrates examples of pseudo-AFM images at different noise levels, and \Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(e) shows a heat map of the mean RMSD between the estimated and ground-truth structures over the range of noise levels. Notably, we found that adding noise to the ``experimental'' pseudo-AFM images consistently led to substantial reductions in prediction accuracy. In contrast, adding noise to the training data alone had a relatively minor effect on the estimation accuracy; indeed, the best performance was achieved when noise-free training data were used. This indicates that, while robustness to noise in the inputs (``experimental'' images) is limited, the presence or absence of noise in the training data does not substantially affect accuracy, with noise-free training data providing the most reliable results. \Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(f) shows a heat map of the mean c.c. between the rigid-body fitted pseudo-AFM images and the ``experimental'' pseudo-AFM images under the same noise levels with the \Cref{fig:noise_robustness}~(e).

%When we used noise-free AFM images as training data, the model accurately extracted features and inferred structures from noise-free inputs. However, it lacked robustness to noisy inputs: inference accuracy degraded substantially when the reference images (inputs) were heavily contaminated by noise. By contrast, using images with comparatively high noise levels for training introduced a trade-off between peak accuracy and robustness. Specifically, even when the input noise matched the training noise, the prediction accuracy did not reach that of the noise-free case. Nevertheless, unlike the noise-free setting, the model retained reasonable accuracy even when the input noise level differed from that of the training data. 

%In general, the noise level of the training data should match that of the target images. Based on these results, the recommended practice depends on the noise level of the reference images. If the reference images have high noise levels ($\gtrsim 0.3$ nm), one should accept somewhat lower reliability, but reasonable accuracy can still be expected even when the input noise level differs from the training data. Conversely, if the reference images are low-noise, highly reliable predictions are achievable, but only when the input noise level is similar to that of the training data; images with markedly different noise levels should not be used as references.

\subsection{Application to real experimental AFM images: A Flagellar Protein \flhac}
\label{subsec:flhac_results}

FlhA is a key component of the flagellar protein export system, and its C-terminal domain, \flhac, helps transport proteins by assisting their binding to the exporter.
Structurally, it comprises four domains (\acdi, \acdii, \acdiii, and \acdiv) and a linker to the transmembrane domain (FlhA\textsubscript{TM}) (\Cref{fig:flhac_statistic}~(a)). 
Previous studies using X-ray crystallography and mutational analysis indicate that hinge motions among these domains influence transport activity and motility \cite{saijo-hamano2010flha}.

\paragraph{Training data preparation and trainning a g-CNN}
We selected \acdi--\acdiv and \acdii--\acdiii as inter-domain distance features.
The candidate conformations and their MolProbity scores are shown in \Cref{fig:flhac_selection}.

\paragraph{Predictions from real AFM images}
To evaluate the applicability of \Model to real AFM data, we estimated the 3D structures using \Model from 159 HS-AFM snapshots of the \flhac monomer.
The randomly selected predictions are shown in \cref{fig:flhac_results}.

As a comparison, we perfoemed rigid-body fitting for both structures estimated by \Model and the PDB database structure.
For almost all cases, \Model reproduced more sililar images with reference images than the PDB database structure (see \cref{fig:flhac_statistic} (b)).

To evaluate the predicted conformations, we computed the inter-domain distance between \acdii and \acdiv for all estimated structures.
This distance serves as a useful indicator to distinguish between open and closed conformations.
The resulting histogram is shown in \cref{fig:flhac_statistic}(c).
For comparison, we also generated 100 structures using AlphaFlow\cite{jing2024alphaflow}, BioEmu\cite{bioemu2025}, and \AFii\cite{mirdita2022colabfold} with MSA subsampling, and plotted their distributions together.
Compared with these models, \Model tends to predict more open conformations.

To interpret this result, we analyzed the predicted conformations as a time series.
As shown in \cref{fig:flhac_statistic}(e), the time correlation between adjacent frames (with a time lag of 1~ms) remains relatively high ($ \sim 0.5$).
Moreover, \Model does not simply predict constant values; as illustrated in \cref{fig:flhac_statistic}(d), the predicted inter-domain distances exhibit substantial transitions over time.
When we randomly shuffled the frame order, the temporal correlation nearly vanished, as indicated by the dotted line in \cref{fig:flhac_statistic}(e).

Although \Model relies solely on AFM images, its ability to predict similar structures for neighboring frames suggests that it is robust to experimental noise and variations in probe shape.
This consistency indicates that \Model can extract meaningful structural information from real AFM data.
