        abstract = {Bacteria use a type III protein export apparatus for construction of the ﬂagellum, which consists of the basal body, the hook, and the ﬁlament. FlhA forms a homo-nonamer through its C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (FlhAC) and ensures the strict order of ﬂagellar assembly. FlhAC goes through dynamic domain motions during protein export, but it remains unknown how it occurs. Here, we report that the FlhA(G368C) mutation biases FlhAC toward a closed form, thereby reducing the binding afﬁnity of FlhAC for ﬂagellar export chaperones in complex with their cognate ﬁlament-type substrates. The G368C mutations also restrict the conformational ﬂexibility of a linker region of FlhA (FlhAL), suppressing FlhAC ring formation. We propose that interactions of FlhAL with its neighboring subunit converts FlhAC in the ring from a closed conformation to an open one, allowing the chaperon/substrate complexes to bind to the FlhAC ring to form the ﬁlament at the hook tip.},

Recent technological progress of AFM in biological research has resulted in remarkable improvements in both the imaging rate and the tip force acting on the sample. These improvements have enabled the direct visualization of dynamic structural changes and dynamic interactions occurring in individual biological macromolecules, which is currently not possible with other techniques. Therefore, high-speed AFM is expected to have a revolutionary impact on biological sciences. In addition, the recently achieved atomic-resolution in liquids will further expand the usefulness of AFM in biological research. In this article, we ﬁrst describe the various capabilities required of AFM in biological sciences, which is followed by a detailed description of various devices and techniques developed for high-speed AFM and atomic-resolution in-liquid AFM. We then describe various imaging studies performed using our cutting-edge microscopes and their current capabilities as well as their limitations, and conclude by discussing the future prospects of AFM as an imaging tool in biological research.},

	abstract = {In this study, we directly imaged subnanometer-scale structures of tubulins by performing frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) in liquid. Individual a-helices at the surface of a tubulin protoﬁlament were imaged as periodic corrugations with a spacing of 0.53 nm, which corresponds to the common pitch of an a-helix backbone (0.54 nm). The identiﬁcation of individual a-helices allowed us to determine the orientation of the deposited tubulin protoﬁlament. As a result, C-terminal domains of tubulins were identiﬁed as protrusions with a height of 0.4 nm from the surface of the tubulin. The imaging mechanism for the observed subnanometer-scale contrasts is discussed in relation to the possible structures of the C-terminal domains. Because the C-terminal domains are chemically modiﬁed to regulate the interactions between tubulins and other biomolecules (e.g., motor proteins and microtubule-associated proteins), detailed structural information on individual C-terminal domains is valuable for understanding such regulation mechanisms. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that FM-AFM is capable of visualizing the structural variation of tubulins with subnanometer resolution. This is an important ﬁrst step toward using FM-AFM to analyze the functions of tubulins.},

We present a novel methodology that combines highresolution AFM topographic images with atomic coordinates of proteins to assemble very large macromolecules or particles. Our method uses a two-step protocol: atomic coordinates of individual domains are docked beneath the molecular surface of the large macromolecule, and then each domain is assembled using a combinatorial search. The protocol was validated on three test cases: a simulated system of antibody structures; and two experimentally based test cases: Tobacco mosaic virus, a rod-shaped virus; and Aquaporin Z, a bacterial membrane protein. We have shown that AFM-intermediate resolution topography and partial surface data are useful constraints for building macromolecular assemblies. The protocol is applicable to multicomponent structures connected in the polypeptide chain or as disjoint molecules. The approach effectively increases the resolution of AFM beyond topographical information down to atomic-detail structures.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can visualize functional biomolecules near the physiological condition, but the observed data are limited to the surface height of specimens. Since the AFM images highly depend on the probe tip shape, for successful inference of molecular structures from the measurement, the knowledge of the probe shape is required, but is often missing. Here, we developed a method of the rigid-body fitting to AFM images, which simultaneously finds the shape of the probe tip and the placement of the molecular structure via an exhaustive search. First, we examined four similarity scores via twin-experiments for four test proteins, finding that the cosine similarity score generally worked best, whereas the pixel-RMSD and the correlation coefficient were also useful. We then applied the method to two experimental high-speed-AFM images inferring the probe shape and the molecular placement. The results suggest that the appropriate similarity score can differ between target systems. For an actin filament image, the cosine similarity apparently worked best. For an image of the flagellar protein FlhAC, we found the correlation coefficient gave better results. This difference may partly be attributed to the flexibility in the target molecule, ignored in the rigid-body fitting. The inferred tip shape and placement results can be further refined by other methods, such as the flexible fitting molecular dynamics simulations. The developed software is publicly available.},
