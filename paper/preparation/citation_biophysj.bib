	abstract = {High-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) experiments allow direct observation of biomolecular dynamics at the single-molecule level, acquiring a large amount of topographic imaging data that visualizes changes in the molecular surface during functional activity over an extended period of time. Since images have no atomistic resolution, a major challenge has been to develop post-experimental computational methods to infer atomistic information from measurements. The recently developed NMFF-AFM flexible fitting method provides a computationally efficient approach promising to infer atomistic-precision models of conformational dynamics from resolutionlimited AFM imaging data. We report the software integration of this method into the well-established BioAFMviewer platform and demonstrate its first applications to experimental HS-AFM imaging data. To facilitate applications, we developed a direct workflow from raw experimental AFM data to the visualization and analysis of fitting results. The presented applications to experimental data of a single protein domain, a protein complex, and a megadalton-sized protein filament demonstrate the versatility of NMFF-AFM modeling to reproduce large-amplitude conformational motions of biomolecular dynamics from HS-AFM imaging. As a first step toward automated large-scale analysis of AFM imaging data, we furthermore demonstrate reconstruction of an atomistic molecular movie of protein dynamics, involving large-amplitude conformational transitions, from a measured HS-AFM movie sequence. Implementation of flexible fitting within the stand-alone user-friendly interactive BioAFMviewer software provides the opportunity for a broad range of applications to facilitate the understanding of resolution-limited HS-AFM measurements.},

        abstract = {Bacteria use a type III protein export apparatus for construction of the ﬂagellum, which consists of the basal body, the hook, and the ﬁlament. FlhA forms a homo-nonamer through its C-terminal cytoplasmic domains (FlhAC) and ensures the strict order of ﬂagellar assembly. FlhAC goes through dynamic domain motions during protein export, but it remains unknown how it occurs. Here, we report that the FlhA(G368C) mutation biases FlhAC toward a closed form, thereby reducing the binding afﬁnity of FlhAC for ﬂagellar export chaperones in complex with their cognate ﬁlament-type substrates. The G368C mutations also restrict the conformational ﬂexibility of a linker region of FlhA (FlhAL), suppressing FlhAC ring formation. We propose that interactions of FlhAL with its neighboring subunit converts FlhAC in the ring from a closed conformation to an open one, allowing the chaperon/substrate complexes to bind to the FlhAC ring to form the ﬁlament at the hook tip.},

Recent technological progress of AFM in biological research has resulted in remarkable improvements in both the imaging rate and the tip force acting on the sample. These improvements have enabled the direct visualization of dynamic structural changes and dynamic interactions occurring in individual biological macromolecules, which is currently not possible with other techniques. Therefore, high-speed AFM is expected to have a revolutionary impact on biological sciences. In addition, the recently achieved atomic-resolution in liquids will further expand the usefulness of AFM in biological research. In this article, we ﬁrst describe the various capabilities required of AFM in biological sciences, which is followed by a detailed description of various devices and techniques developed for high-speed AFM and atomic-resolution in-liquid AFM. We then describe various imaging studies performed using our cutting-edge microscopes and their current capabilities as well as their limitations, and conclude by discussing the future prospects of AFM as an imaging tool in biological research.},

	abstract = {In this study, we directly imaged subnanometer-scale structures of tubulins by performing frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM) in liquid. Individual a-helices at the surface of a tubulin protoﬁlament were imaged as periodic corrugations with a spacing of 0.53 nm, which corresponds to the common pitch of an a-helix backbone (0.54 nm). The identiﬁcation of individual a-helices allowed us to determine the orientation of the deposited tubulin protoﬁlament. As a result, C-terminal domains of tubulins were identiﬁed as protrusions with a height of 0.4 nm from the surface of the tubulin. The imaging mechanism for the observed subnanometer-scale contrasts is discussed in relation to the possible structures of the C-terminal domains. Because the C-terminal domains are chemically modiﬁed to regulate the interactions between tubulins and other biomolecules (e.g., motor proteins and microtubule-associated proteins), detailed structural information on individual C-terminal domains is valuable for understanding such regulation mechanisms. The results obtained in this study demonstrate that FM-AFM is capable of visualizing the structural variation of tubulins with subnanometer resolution. This is an important ﬁrst step toward using FM-AFM to analyze the functions of tubulins.},

We present a novel methodology that combines highresolution AFM topographic images with atomic coordinates of proteins to assemble very large macromolecules or particles. Our method uses a two-step protocol: atomic coordinates of individual domains are docked beneath the molecular surface of the large macromolecule, and then each domain is assembled using a combinatorial search. The protocol was validated on three test cases: a simulated system of antibody structures; and two experimentally based test cases: Tobacco mosaic virus, a rod-shaped virus; and Aquaporin Z, a bacterial membrane protein. We have shown that AFM-intermediate resolution topography and partial surface data are useful constraints for building macromolecular assemblies. The protocol is applicable to multicomponent structures connected in the polypeptide chain or as disjoint molecules. The approach effectively increases the resolution of AFM beyond topographical information down to atomic-detail structures.},

To overcome such drawbacks, we developed a computational framework to reconstruct 3D atomistic structures from AFM surface scans, employing simulation AFM and automatized fitting to experimental images. We provide applications to AFM images ranging from single molecular machines, protein filaments, to large-scale assemblies of 2D protein lattices, and demonstrate how the obtained full atomistic information advances the molecular understanding beyond the original topographic AFM image. We show that simulation AFM further allows for quantitative molecular feature assignment within measured AFM topographies. Implementation of the developed methods into the versatile interactive interface of the BioAFMviewer software, freely available at www.bioafmviewer.com, presents the opportunity for the broad Bio-AFM community to employ the enormous amount of existing structural and modeling data to facilitate the interpretation of resolution-limited AFM images.},

	abstract = {Atomic force microscopy (AFM) can visualize functional biomolecules near the physiological condition, but the observed data are limited to the surface height of specimens. Since the AFM images highly depend on the probe tip shape, for successful inference of molecular structures from the measurement, the knowledge of the probe shape is required, but is often missing. Here, we developed a method of the rigid-body fitting to AFM images, which simultaneously finds the shape of the probe tip and the placement of the molecular structure via an exhaustive search. First, we examined four similarity scores via twin-experiments for four test proteins, finding that the cosine similarity score generally worked best, whereas the pixel-RMSD and the correlation coefficient were also useful. We then applied the method to two experimental high-speed-AFM images inferring the probe shape and the molecular placement. The results suggest that the appropriate similarity score can differ between target systems. For an actin filament image, the cosine similarity apparently worked best. For an image of the flagellar protein FlhAC, we found the correlation coefficient gave better results. This difference may partly be attributed to the flexibility in the target molecule, ignored in the rigid-body fitting. The inferred tip shape and placement results can be further refined by other methods, such as the flexible fitting molecular dynamics simulations. The developed software is publicly available.},

	abstract = {Background
Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is an experimental technique to study structure-function relationship of biomolecules. AFM provides images of biomolecules at nanometer resolution. High-speed AFM experiments produce a series of images following dynamics of biomolecules. To further understand biomolecular functions, information on three-dimensional (3D) structures is beneficial.
Method
We aim to recover 3D information from an AFM image by computational modeling. The AFM image includes only low-resolution representation of a molecule; therefore we represent the structures by a coarse grained model (Gaussian mixture model). Using Monte-Carlo sampling, candidate models are generated to increase similarity between AFM images simulated from the models and target AFM image.
Results
The algorithm was tested on two proteins to model their conformational transitions. Using a simulated AFM image as reference, the algorithm can produce a low-resolution 3D model of the target molecule. Effect of molecular orientations captured in AFM images on the 3D modeling performance was also examined and it is shown that similar accuracy can be obtained for many orientations.
Conclusions
The proposed algorithm can generate 3D low-resolution protein models, from which conformational transitions observed in AFM images can be interpreted in more detail.
General significance
High-speed AFM experiments allow us to directly observe biomolecules in action, which provides insights on biomolecular function through dynamics. However, as only partial structural information can be obtained from AFM data, this new AFM based hybrid modeling method would be useful to retrieve 3D information of the entire biomolecule.},

The function of this protein relies on the interconversion between different conformations in its native condition. A recent high-speed-atomic-force-microscopy (HS-AFM) experiment on ClpB from {\textless}italic{\textgreater}Thermus thermophilus{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} shows four predominant conformational classes, namely, open, closed, spiral, and half-spiral. Analyses of AFM images provide only partial structural information regarding the molecular surface, and thus computational modeling of three-dimensional (3D) structures of these conformations should help interpret dynamical events related to ClpB functions. In this study, we reconstruct 3D models of ClpB from HS-AFM images in different conformational classes. We have applied our recently developed computational method based on a low-resolution representation of 3D structure using a Gaussian mixture model, combined with a Monte-Carlo sampling algorithm to optimize the agreement with target AFM images. After conformational sampling, we obtained models that reflect conformational variety embedded within the AFM images. From these reconstructed 3D models, we described, in terms of relative domain arrangement, the different types of ClpB oligomeric conformations observed by HS-AFM experiments. In particular, we highlighted the slippage of the monomeric components around the seam. This study demonstrates that such details of information, necessary for annotating the different conformational states involved in the ClpB function, can be obtained by combining HS-AFM images, even with limited resolution, and computational modeling.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The Amber ff99SB force field improved protein secondary structure balance and dynamics from earlier force fields like ff99, but weaknesses in side chain rotamer and backbone secondary structure preferences have been identified. Here, we performed a complete refit of all amino acid side chain dihedral parameters, which had been carried over from ff94. The training set of conformations included multidimensional dihedral scans designed to improve transferability of the parameters. Improvement in all amino acids was obtained as compared to ff99SB. Parameters were also generated for alternate protonation states of ionizable side chains. Average errors in relative energies of pairs of conformations were under 1.0 kcal/mol as compared to QM, reduced 35\% from ff99SB. We also took the opportunity to make empirical adjustments to the protein backbone dihedral parameters as compared to ff99SB. Multiple small adjustments of φ and ψ parameters were tested against NMR scalar coupling data and secondary structure content for short peptides. The best results were obtained from a physically motivated adjustment to the φ rotational profile that compensates for lack of ff99SB QM training data in the β-ppII transition region. Together, these backbone and side chain modifications (hereafter called ff14SB) not only better reproduced their benchmarks, but also improved secondary structure content in small peptides and reproduction of NMR χ1 scalar coupling measurements for proteins in solution. We also discuss the Amber ff12SB parameter set, a preliminary version of ff14SB that includes most of its improvements.},
